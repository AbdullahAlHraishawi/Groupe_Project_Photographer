      <ol><h3>You know that I believe in actionable steps, concrete ideas and no-fluff concepts, and so I want to clarify
        the idea of “designing” your customer experience. Very specifically, I am suggesting that you need to write out
        each and every step that you want each client to go through and then develop a system to implement that flow and
        ensure it is repeatable, sustainable and measurable.</h3>
